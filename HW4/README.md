Choose any one method and one cost function described in this paper  and read about it in detail. You should be prepared to write the cost function, describe it,  discuss the merit of the method and its applications (e.g. is it good for 1 poc or N poc? ) **quizzes may contain questions about this**

# Assignments
## Assignment 1

Find Points of Change in syntetic and earthquake time series

https://github.com/fedhere/MLTSA_FBianco/blob/master/HW4/chchchchanges_instructions.ipynb


## Assignment 2: Choose one between
### 1a: Work on state space and additive models for climate change  with PyDLM
https://github.com/fedhere/MLTSA_FBianco/blob/master/HW4/ClimateBSTS_instructions.ipynb

This honework will teach you skills in data integration and fusion and on the creation and interpretaation of additive models



### 1b: Probabilistic outlier detection with MCMC

https://github.com/fedhere/MLTSA_FBianco/blob/master/HW4/MCMCOutliers_Probability_instructions.ipynb

Few things are as usuful in data analysis as MCMC. It is really ubiquitous and extremely helpful in everything including time series analysis.  This homework will teach you to write down an likelihood and integrate it into the emcee and interpret the results. In addition it will show you how to create plots and write labels. 
Note: there are captions for you to fill in throughout: e.g. Caption 4


Extra Credit.... do the other one (1b if you chose 1a, 1a if you chose 1b). The highest scoring notebook of the 2 will be considered for HW4 grade, the performance on the other one will be considered for the EC
