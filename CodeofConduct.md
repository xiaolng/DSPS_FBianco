# Machine Learning for Time Series Analysis Code of Conduct

PHYS461/661 : Data Science for Physical Scientists 2021

Code of Conduct:

# TL;DR
# Diversity is considered a resource that enriches us culturally and intellectually in this class. No instances of harassment or attempts to marginalize students will be tolerated in this class. Be respectful and collaborate instead of competing: everyone, including you, will benefit from it. If you have concerns please come talk to me 
# The following Code of Conduct applies to all interactions of members of this class in the context of the course, online and offline, including social media, mailing lists, forums, meetings, labs, slack, canvas, and one-to-one interactions.
# If you have concerns, if you do not feel safe or are made to feel unwelcome in this class,  please come talk to me. If you see instances of ill-natured interactions please come talk to me. 
Keep in mind that I am a mandatory reporter according to 
[Title IX](https://sites.udel.edu/sexualmisconduct/how-to-report/guidelines-for-reporting/), so if you report to me instances of discrimination and harassment I have to report the complaint to the UDel administration. However, there are many additional resources, inculding confidential resource at UDel if you wish to employ independent reporting channels; 
please see [this list of resources](UDelResources.md). 

- All members of the class should be treated with respect regardless of personal attributes, including but not limited to: race, ethnicity, gender or gender identity, physical appearance, physical abilities, religious beliefs, political affiliation or opinions, sexual preference, caregiver status, age, nationality, language.

- Harassment, verbal or physical, is not tolerated. Keep in mind that what is acceptable to one person may not be acceptable to another.

- Bullying, including physical bullying, exclusion, marginalization, disparagement, or intimidation, is not tolerated.

- All members of the class are empowered to request that an undesirable behavior is dismissed.
Own your intention but also own your impact: all members are expected to immediately stop any behavior inconsistent with the Code of Conduct regardless of original intent.

- This Code of Conduct supplements, and does not overwrite, the Codes of Conduct that you are bound to in your role at UDel. For example here is the UDel students' CoC

# Group Interactions and calass conduct:
I expect to see a supportive, collaborative attitude from all students to assure we maintain and foster a learning environment that leads to rigor, excellence, and happiness. This includes:

- be mindful of cultural norms. Make sure you know how your teammates want to be addressed (e.g. ask their preferred pronoun; mine is she/her/hers). Do not interrupt your teammates while they are speaking, do not speak over teammates and be aware and respectful of the natural volume of their voice. Be respectful of individual communication skills and fluency in the common languages we speak.

- be available, within reason, to share knowledge and do so respectfully. Never make a teammate feel bad for not knowing something you already know. It is not your role to assess your teammates' efforts or knowledge. If you feel like supporting a teammate is getting in the way of your productivity in the group, bring this concern to me directly.

- be conscientious and value your classmates and TAs time when asking for help. Make sure you have done your share of weight lifting: you have reviewed the resources available to the group and looked around for answers when applicable. Prepare yourself to receive help: be prepared to ask clear questions and to be able to show and demonstrate the issues you are having. Your classmates and TAs should not be expected to struggle to understand what your problem or question is

- use your phone or laptop or phone while in class or lab to work on exercises together and take notes or find resources to contribute to the conversation (when allowed). This is out of respect for your classmates, TAs, and instructors: if they are speaking they should be heard!

- be on time for class

- if attending remotely consider turning on your camera if you are comfortable with it to help us communicate with each other more easily. But we do not require that you do.
- 
Every day I try to remind myself of all these norms, but I do too fail to respect them at times. If you notice that I have not followed any of these rules, or you think I am adopting behaviors that make you uncomfortable please promptly let me know!


Thank you!
