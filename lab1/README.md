If you do not have access to a terminal (bash, csh, powershell... let me know. If you run a mac or linux you just need to open a terminal. If you run Windows let me know what version and I'll help you figure out how to install one. You can do most of the homework on your own, but you need a partner to finish up the second part. Get as far as you can in it and let me know if you need help.
