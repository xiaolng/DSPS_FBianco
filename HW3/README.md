# READING: 
Read the paper you re reproducing in KS_earthquakes.ipynb: [Corral 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0910.0055.pdf).
I am not trying to turn you into an earthquake specialist, so you do not need to absorbe all of it in detail. Focus on understanding the goal and how the KS test was used to achieve that goal. 

# WATCHING: 
Geoff West [TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/geoffrey_west_the_surprising_math_of_cities_and_corporations?utm_campaign=tedspread&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=tedcomshare) about scaling laws in phsyics from biology to urban science

Work in groups of 3 to 5 people. 
Remember to include a README.md, in markdown format, that states how your team worked: who you worked with and what you contributed specifically.
